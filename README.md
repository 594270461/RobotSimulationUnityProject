# RobotSimulationUnityProject

##Presentation 

This project is about a modular robot which is simulated with standart sensors which can be interfaced with a real system without many change in the main code.

The purposes of that are multiple, the first step is to give to student an easy tool to use to control the simulator as a real virtual robot then switch easily to a real robot.

The Unity part can be considered as the virtual robot part, which will connect through TCP/IP protocol to a server to send the sensor's data then it will receive from the server the command.

An API will be developped to make it more comfortable to use.
